# E-Commerce Database

## Description
A mysql database for an e-commerce website that holds data pertaining to retail categories, products, and tags.

## Installation
Once the code is in your local files, first open the mysql Shell from the command line and run 'source db/schema.sql.' Then seed the database by running 'npm run seed' from the command line, followed by 'npm start' to start the server.

## Usage
The primary function of this e-commerce database is to store retail information, including which products belong to which categories, and which products have various tags. After starting the server, the user can use api calls to get all, get one, post one, update one, or delete one from the categories, products, or tags in the database.
